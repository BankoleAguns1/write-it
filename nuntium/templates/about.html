<h2>About This Site</h2>

<p>Got a question for a politician? Want to hold someone to account, get
answers, or just make a point?</p>

<p>We believe that when conversations are held in public, great things
happen:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It’s easier to hold people in power to their word.</li>
  <li>There’s a permanent record of everything that’s been said.</li>
  <li>You can share the correspondence with anyone, at any time.</li>
  <li>And all the while, you’re helping to build a public archive of
  conversations about the things that matter.</li>
</ul>

<p>That’s why we built {{ writeitinstance.name }}. </p>

{% comment "needs #914" %}
With just a few clicks, you can
now send messages to any member of [name of database]. </p>
{% endcomment %}

<h3>How does it work?</h3>

<p>Pick your 
recipient{% if writeitinstance.config.maximum_recipients > 1 %}s{% endif %},
compose your letter, and press ‘Send’.</p>

<p>Once you’ve confirmed your email address, we’ll send your message on
its way, and also publish it on this site for everyone to see.</p>

<p>When you get a reply, we’ll publish that too.</p>

{% comment "needs #263" %}
Perhaps you’d like to continue the conversation? No problem: just click on ‘reply’, and off
you go. All in public.</p>
{% endcomment %}

<h3>How public is ‘public’?</h3>

<p><b>We’ll publish your message, and your name alongside it, on this
public website.</b> You should be aware that, as a result, your
message will appear in future searches for your name on search
engines. Anyone browsing this site will also be able to see it.</p>

<p><b>We encourage the use of real names</b>, although it’s not
mandatory. Your chosen recipient will be obliged to use his or her real
name when replying, and we think it’s only right that you extend them
the same courtesy. If you’re not happy to put your name to a message,
we’d suggest that you don’t send it.</p>

<p><b>We won’t publish your email address</b>. We ask for it so that we can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>verify that your message has come from a genuine person, not a
  spammer or a bot</li>
  <li>alert you when you receive a reply from your recipient</li>
  <li>let you know of any issues or problems we may have had sending your
  message</li>
  <li>(rarely) send you important information about the site.</li>
</ul>
