<h1>
  How WriteIt works
</h1>
<p>
  <strong>
    WriteIt is a zero-config factory for building sites that empower citizens
    to send emails to representatives and politicians.
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  If you've got a list of the representatives' names and email addresses, 
  WriteIt makes it easy for people to send them emails. In its simplest form,
  it's a website where a user chooses the representative's name, types their
  message in the box, and clicks to send it.
</p>
<h3>
  Isn't that just... email?
</h3>
<p>
  Yes, WriteIt <em>uses</em> email. But there are some important things here:
  first, your users don't need to know the email address of the representative
  you're sending to (it might be hard to find, or it might keep changing). But if
  your WriteIt database has it, they can send the message. Secondly, WriteIt 
  can be configured to run as a <em>strong</em> public service. We call this
  WriteInPublic, and it published both the outgoing message and any replies.
</p>
<h3>
  How does it work?
</h3>
<h4>
  Non-technical answer
</h4>
<p>
  When a WriteIt site sends an email on behalf of a user, it makes a <em>totally
  unique</em> email address and sends the message <strong>from</strong> that.
  This means that when someone (maybe the politician it was sent to, or their
  staff) replies, WriteIt knows it's the response to that message, and no others.
  WriteIt can then forward the reply to the user who sent the message to start
  with. 
</p>
<p>
  Often the hardest part of this is getting the names and addresses of all the 
  people to write to in the first place (for example, all the politicians in your country's top-level
  legislature). We believe that if you can do that, letting people use that data
  ought to be easy. So WriteIt is very easy to set up: all you need is that list
  of names and email addresses. 
</p>
<h4>
  Technical answer
</h4>
<p>
  WriteIt is a Django application with a database of contact details. It usually
  runs as a website, but also has an API so you can drive it programmatically too.
  It has a web interface for administrative tasks, including importing data
  (WriteIt likes data in the Popolo format).
