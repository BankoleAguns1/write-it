title : We have a simple yet power blog to discuss about write-it development
---

Hi there!
thank you for reading these humble lines.
We hope this blog will host very interesting discussing about what we should do, what we have done, what we haven't done, failures and succeses on the development of a easy-to-use messaging tool.
Our first challenge was to set this blog up: first success.
Our second challenge is to find an proper architecture for our messaging project, hopefully it will be very extensible. [Open Closed Principle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open/closed_principle) is our theoretical model. Please keep intouch to find out if we fail or success in this, our second challenge.

See you later!
