# Integration Guide

There are essentially two ways to use WriteIt. Either have users interact with WriteIt directly or integrate it with another application and only use WriteIt as a backend for sending and receiving messages.

This guide assumes you have WriteIt setup and wish fully integrate it into your application, i.e. users will not know that WriteIt is involved at all.

## Sending messages

TOOD: The first step is to send email to WriteIt.


## Templates

TODO: You need to ensure the email templates are configured correctly as the standard ones will send people to the WriteIt interface.

## Receiving messages

TODO: When someone replies to a message, how does it get to your application?
